# Highlights

This project provides a simulation platform for super-pressure balloons, featuring both a Simulink/MATLAB-based simulation and a quasi-physical model implemented in Gazebo/ROS 2. The experiments are conducted on a real platform weighing 75 grams, which is capable of tracking the desired altitude, estimating wind conditions, and making autonomous decisions.

# Simulations
We present results obtained from both Simulink/MATLAB and Gazebo/ROS 2 simulations, using parameters based on a real balloon to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results are divided into two parts: (1) tracking the desired altitude, and (2) autonomous balloon behavior that estimates wind conditions and makes decisions to maintain a specific position.## Simulink/Matlab

# Experiments
## Design and Hardware Setup
The balloon is designed in SolidWorks, and all parts are 3D-printed. A 36-inch latex balloon is used in the project. The visual design in SolidWorks and the hardware setup are shown in the following figure:

The SolidWorks assembly and all the parts used can be found in the Balloon folder. <br> 

The control board is powered by an ESP8266 module, which communicates with the ground station via the TCP protocol. For the indoor prototype, the balloonâ€™s position is measured using the MTF-02P Optical & Range Sensor. All components are carried by a 36-inch latex balloon, with a total system weight of 75 grams. <br> 

For the setup of the station-keeping experiment, refer to the following figure: <br>
