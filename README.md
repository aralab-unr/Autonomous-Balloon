# Highlights

This project provides a simulation platform for super-pressure balloons, featuring both a Simulink/MATLAB-based simulation and a quasi-physical model implemented in Gazebo/ROS 2. The experiments are conducted on a real platform weighing 75 grams, which is capable of tracking the desired altitude, estimating wind conditions, and making autonomous decisions.
