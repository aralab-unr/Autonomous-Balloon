# Highlights

This project provides a simulation platform for super-pressure balloons, featuring both a Simulink/MATLAB-based simulation and a quasi-physical model implemented in Gazebo/ROS 2. The experiments are conducted on a real platform weighing 75 grams, which is capable of tracking the desired altitude, estimating wind conditions, and making autonomous decisions.

# Simulations
We present results obtained from both Simulink/MATLAB and Gazebo/ROS 2 simulations, using parameters based on a real balloon to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results are divided into two parts: (1) tracking the desired altitude, and (2) an autonomous balloon that estimates wind conditions and makes decisions to maintain a specific position.

# Simulink/Matlab
The diagram of the simulation in MATLAB/Simulink is presented as follows:

The simulation files are located in the BalloonMatlab folder. The SPballoonASMC.slx file is used for tracking the desired altitude, while the SPballoonASMCPOMDPfull.slx file is for simulating the autonomous balloon.

## Gazebo/ROS 2
The visual model of the balloon in Gazebo is shown below:

The simulation on Gazebo/ROS 2 running on the following software setup: 
- Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS2 Humble
- Gazebo 11
- Xarco-ROS-Humble (sudo apt install ros-humble-xacro)
- Gazebo_ros_pkgs (sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs)


To set up the simulation on Gazebo/ROS 2 :

```shell
# Step 1: Create and build a colcon workspace:
$ mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/
$ colcon build
$ echo "source ~/ros2_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

# Step 2: Download the source file on the folder rosballoon into your workspace
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/src
Download the folder rosballoon in the main branch

# Step 3: Build the colcon workspace for this package
$ cd ~/ros2_ws
$ colcon build
```

To run the simulation on Gazebo/ROS 2 :

```shell
# Step 1: Create and build a colcon workspace:
$ mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/
$ colcon build
$ echo "source ~/ros2_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

# Step 2: Download the source file on the folder rosballoon into your workspace
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/src
Download the folder rosballoon in the main branch

# Step 3: Build the colcon workspace for this package
$ cd ~/ros2_ws
$ colcon build
```

# Experiments
## Design and Hardware Setup
The balloon is designed in SolidWorks, and all parts are 3D-printed. A 36-inch latex balloon is used in the project. The visual design in SolidWorks and the hardware setup are shown in the following figure:

The SolidWorks assembly and all the parts used can be found in the Balloon folder. <br> 

The control board is powered by an ESP8266 module, which communicates with the ground station via the TCP protocol. For the indoor prototype, the balloonâ€™s position is measured using the MTF-02P Optical & Range Sensor. All components are carried by a 36-inch latex balloon, with a total system weight of 75 grams. <br> 

For the setup of the station-keeping experiment, refer to the following figure: <br>
